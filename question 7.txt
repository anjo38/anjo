Effect of Changing width and height

Increasing the values (e.g., width="800" and height="450") makes the embedded video player larger.

Decreasing the values (e.g., width="300" and height="169") makes it smaller.

If the aspect ratio is not maintained properly, the video might appear stretched or compressed.

Setting width="100%" makes the video responsive, adapting to the width of the parentÂ container.
